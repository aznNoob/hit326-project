But how do I know if I have long COVID?', 'Today officially marks the first day of winter in Australia, but we&#039;re already in the thick of an increase in COVID-19 cases.\r\n\r\nSome people take longer than others to bounce back after a bout of illness, but how do you tell the difference between a slow recovery and long COVID?\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s unpack what we know about COVID&#039;s lasting shadow.\r\n\r\nWhen does COVID become long COVID?\r\nIn simple terms, if you&#039;ve had a COVID infection and you still have symptoms after three months it could be long COVID, explains Anthony Byrne.\r\n\r\nHe is an associate professor at the long COVID clinic at St Vincent&#039;s Hospital in Sydney and says there are two time frames to pay attention to: \r\n\r\nPersisting symptoms after 28 days are known as a &quot;post-acute infection&quot;\r\nPersisting symptoms after three months could be considered long COVID.\r\n&quot;Unless someone can find a better explanation,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes we can, sometimes we can&#039;t.&quot; \r\n\r\nHe also said a long COVID diagnosis is dependent on the persistence of symptoms that &quot;are not otherwise explained by an alternative diagnosis&quot;\r\n\r\nHow can I tell if I have long COVID? \r\nIt can be really difficult. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s because many symptoms overlap with other conditions, Deakin University&#039;s chair of epidemiology Catherine Bennett says. \r\n\r\nIf you suspect you might have long COVID, she suggests it&rsquo;s best to see a doctor or respiratory physician to start the process. \r\n\r\nMore than 200 symptoms have now been associated with long COVID, affecting almost every organ system in the human body.\r\n\r\nBut work&#039;s being done to narrow it down.', 'published'),
